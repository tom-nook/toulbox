Hi, thank you for visiting my site! 

I'm Toul and somehow I've managed to build a career in tech.

I say *somehow* because I'm a non-traditional software engineer. 

No one in my family is in tech, and I didn't even know what programming was until I was 21. 

As you might imagine it was hard to learn and it was even harder to figure out what employers wanted in terms of tech stacks and professionalism.

So, I'm here to share what worked for me and to share what is *working* for me as a software engineer to help you get into tech.
