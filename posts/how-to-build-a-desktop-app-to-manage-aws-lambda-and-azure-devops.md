<!-- Excerpt Start -->

In this post I cover how to build a desktop app using [GoLang](), [Wails](), and [Svelte]() to interact with AWS Lambda and Azure DevOps from your local machine. It is meant as a fun side project so we're going to keep things as simple as possible.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

## Rough Outline of the Project

For the AWS cloud interaction we will assume that the user has the AWS CLI installed on their local machine w/the appropriate access level. The same goes for the AZURE CLI tool. To keep things simple the Go Code is going to be using shell/terminal commands to call the AZURE and AWS CLI tools, in a desktop GUI. So, we will not be using the aws-sdk-go or azure-sdk-go.

## Prerequisite

- [How to Install Wails]()
- [How to Install Svelte]()
- [How to install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-mac.html)
- [How to Sign Up for an AWS Account]()
- [How to Sign Up for an Azure Account]()

## Part I. Setting up the Project

### I.a Wails setup

First, after following [How to Install Wails](),
set up wails for your machine:

```json

| | /| / / __ `/ / / ___/
| |/ |/ / /_/ / / (__  )  v1.8.1
|__/|__/\__,_/_/_/____/   https://wails.app
The lightweight framework for web-like apps

What is your name (Toul):

ðŸš€ Ready for take off!
Create your first project by running 'wails init'.
```

### I.b Wails Init

Now, create project

```

### I.c Wails serve

Run, wails serve to start the bridge between GoLang (Backend) and the Frontend (Svelte)

```json
toul@M1 test % wails serve

## Part II. Building the AWS Lambda Interaction

In this part we'll build a CRUD interface for uploading GoLang Lambdas to AWS Cloud.

### II.a Create an AWS GoLang Lambda

We'll follow the documentation [AWS GoLang Lambda Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/golang-package.html) and add a shim for a wrapper around the `AWS CLI tool` so that our Go code can call the AWS CLI tool rather than using the aws-sdk. This is the path of least resistance as the aws cli already handles the management of user credentials and interaction with the AWS Service API's.

```json
> go get github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda
```

The trick is to use GO to run the AWS CLI through the GO code.
