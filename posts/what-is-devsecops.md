## What is a DevSecOps Engineer

<!-- Excerpt Start -->
The DevSecOps Engineer role is a relatively new role that has come into existence during the past decade in I.T. and seems hard to define.

Part of what makes the position challenging to understand is that it is continually changing due to new technologies.

However, a good start at understanding it is to realize that it is a mix of several different roles; software engineer, sysadmin, security engineer, network engineer, and more.

Of the roles, the ones with the most massive influence are software engineer, sysadmin, and security analyst. I think the  Dev piece of DevOps is Software Engineering, the Ops is sysadmin, and Sec is the security analyst.

With that mindset, then the following will make sense.

> A DevSeOps Engineer is responsible for building software that automates the developer experience, sysadmin responsibilities, and incorporates security focus from step one.

This post demonstrates what a DevSecOps engineer does and what DevSecOps culture is and isn't using Github Actions (CI), GoLang, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk (CD).
